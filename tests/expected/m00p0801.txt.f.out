[Kunan](2):  When we go to [CS:P]Mt. Travail[CR], you\nshould be the leader, [hero].
[Kunan](3):  When we go to [CS:P]Mt. Travail[CR], you\nshould go as the leader, [hero].
[Kunan](1):  After all, that\'s the way we\'ve\nalways done it for important missions.
[Kunan](2):  After all, that\'s the way we\'ve\nalways handled things on important missions.
[Kunan](3):  After all, we\'ve always gone on\nour important missions that way.
[Kunan](1):  So I was thinking that you ought\nto be the leader again, [hero]...[K]\nWhat do you say?
[Kunan](2):  That\'s why I think you should\nbe the leader again, [hero]...[K]\nWhat do you say?
[Kunan](3):  That\'s why I think you should\nbe the leader again, [hero]...[K]\nWhat do you say?
[case_menu]: Accept leadership
[Kunan](1):  Cool![K] That\'s it, then! You\'re the\nleader, [hero].
[Kunan](2):  OK![K] That\'s settled. You\'re the\nleader, [hero].
[Kunan](3):  OK![K] You\'re the team leader,\n[hero]!
[Kunan](1):  Let\'s get rolling to [CS:P]Mt. Travail[CR]!
[Kunan](2):  Let\'s set out for [CS:P]Mt. Travail[CR]!
[Kunan](3):  We should get moving to\n[CS:P]Mt. Travail[CR]!
[case_menu]: Refuse
[Kunan](1):  Whoa![K] Hang on, we\'re going\nwith me as leader?
[Kunan](2):  What?[K] Wait, so I\'m going as\nthe leader?
[Kunan](3):  What?[K] So I\'m going to go as\nthe leader?
[Kunan](1):  Hmm...[K] I don\'t feel confident\nabout doing that...
[Kunan](2):  Hmm...[K] I don\'t have the\nconfidence to do that...
[Kunan](3):  Hmm...[K] I don\'t feel confident\nenough to be the leader...
[Kunan](1):  If we\'re going to [CS:P]Mt. Travail[CR],\nyou should be the leader, [hero]...
[Kunan](2):  If we\'re going to [CS:P]Mt. Travail[CR],\nyou should be the leader, [hero]...
[Kunan](3):  If we\'re still going to go to\n[CS:P]Mt. Travail[CR], you should lead, [hero]...
[Kunan](1):  Hey, [hero].[K] How about if\nwe just go as a pair, you and I?
[Kunan](2):  Listen, [hero].[K] What\nwould you say if I suggested that just you and\nI go?
[Kunan](3):  Say, [hero].[K] Do you think\nmaybe we should just go as a pair, us two?
[Kunan](1):  If a whole bunch of us went,\nit\'d probably upset [CS:N]Drowzee[CR] beyond the point\nof persuasion...
[Kunan](2):  If a whole group went, [CS:N]Drowzee[CR]\nwould probably get upset. You can forget about\npersuading him then.
[Kunan](3):  If a whole lot of us go, [CS:N]Drowzee[CR]\nwill probably get upset with us. He would be\nimpossible to persuade like that.
[Kunan](1):  But going alone won\'t do it,\neither. One Pokémon won\'t be convincing\nenough.
[Kunan](2):  But going alone won\'t be enough.\nI don\'t think it would be persuasive enough to\nget the point across.
[Kunan](3):  But I think one Pokémon alone\nwon\'t be persuasive enough.
[Kunan](1):  So how about just we two go?
[Kunan](2):  That\'s why I suggested the two\nof us go.
[Kunan](3):  So what do you think? Should\njust the two of us go?
[case_menu]: Go as a pair
