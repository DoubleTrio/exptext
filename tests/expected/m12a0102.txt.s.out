[Azurill]: Really?!
[Azurill]: I said I would go too!
[Azurill]: We need your help finding a Water Float.
[Azurill]: Kunan and Yugure! Hi there!
[Kunan](3): It's a ransom note! Isn't it?!
[Kunan](2): "...is now in our possession."
[Kunan](1): Let's go, Yugure! Onward to Amp Plains!
[Kunan](1): "...I bet you can't even reach us! Chaw-haw-haw!"
[Kunan](3): Don't worry, though. We'll get it back for you. We promise!
[Kunan](2): Oh! It's you little guys...
[Kunan](2): Don't worry, though. We'll get it back for you. It's a promise!
[Kunan](2): "Can't handle it? Go cry to your big-shot friends! Chaw-haw-haw!" Hey! This note! It's a...
[Kunan](1): Don't worry, though. We'll get it back for you. Sure thing!
[Kunan](3): "Just try to take it from us! We'll wait in the deepest part of Amp Plains."
[Kunan](3): You should see your faces! All that crying and laughing... C'mon!
[Kunan](3): This scrap of paper?
[Kunan](2): You should see your faces! All that crying and laughing... C'mon!
[Kunan](2): You little guys! Promise me you won't go yourself.
[Kunan](1): You should see your faces! All that crying and laughing... C'mon!
[Kunan](1): It's a ransom note! Isn't it?!
[Kunan](3): A Water Float?
[Kunan](3): Let's go, Yugure! Let's get to Amp Plains!
[Kunan](3): Yep! So no more tears!
[Kunan](2): "But knowing how weak and puny you are..."
[Kunan](2): Yep! So no more tears!
[Kunan](1): "Just try to take it from us! We'll wait in the deepest part of Amp Plains."
[Kunan](1): Yup! So no more crying!
[Kunan](2): Let's go, Yugure! We're off to Amp Plains!
[Kunan](3): Let's see. What does it say? "The Water Float from the beach..."
[Kunan](2): A Water Float?
[Kunan](1): This scrap of paper?
[Kunan](3): We'll go get the Water Float back for you.
[Kunan](2): Weren't you looking for that earlier? A Water Float?
[Kunan](2): We'll go get the Water Float back for you.
[Kunan](1): You little guys shouldn't even think about going!
[Kunan](1): We'll go and get the Water Float back for you.
[Kunan](2): It's a ransom note! Isn't it?!
[Kunan](3): No problem! I know what to do!
[Kunan](3): "Can't handle it? Go cry to your big-shot friends! Chaw-haw-haw!" Hey! This note! It's a...
[Kunan](2): No problem! I know what to do!
[Kunan](1): "Can't handle it? Go cry to your big-shot friends! Chaw-haw-haw!" Hey! This note! It's a...
[Kunan](1): No problem! I know what to do!
[Kunan](2): "...I bet you can't even reach us! Chaw-haw-haw!"
[Kunan](1): A Water Float?
[Kunan](3): "But knowing how weak and puny you are..."
[Kunan](1): Huh? It's you little guys...
[Kunan](1): "But knowing how weak and puny you are..."
[Kunan](3): Help?
[Kunan](2): "Just try to take it from us! We'll wait in the deepest part of Amp Plains."
[Kunan](2): Help?
[Kunan](3): "...is now in our possession."
[Kunan](1): Help?
[Kunan](1): "...is now in our possession."
[Kunan](1): Let's see. What does it say? "The Water Float from the beach..."
[Kunan](2): Let's see. What does it say? "The Water Float from the beach..."
[Kunan](1): We heard we have visitors. Are you our visitors?
[Kunan](2): There's writing on it.
[Kunan](3): There's writing on it.
[Kunan](3): We heard we have visitors. Are you maybe those visitors?
[Kunan](1): There's writing on it.
[Kunan](2): We heard we have visitors. Are you our visitors?
[Kunan](2): This scrap of paper?
[Kunan](3): It's probably a trap!
[Kunan](3): Hey! It's you little guys...
[Kunan](2): I suspect a trap.
[Kunan](3): Isn't that what you were looking for earlier? A Water Float?
[Kunan](1): It could be a trap.
[Kunan](1): You've been searching for your Water Float, right?
[Kunan](3): You little guys! Please don't even think about going.
[Kunan](3): "...I bet you can't even reach us! Chaw-haw-haw!"
[Marill]: Yep! We wanted to ask Team Spirits for help.
[Marill]: OK! W-we're sorry to bother you about this. Thank you!
[Marill]: We really want to get it back.
[Marill]: You will?!
[Marill]: Yep! Someone said one was lying on the beach. We went there looking for it!
[Marill]: I just c-c-can't stand how weak I am...
[Marill]: But I can't take Azurill to a dangerous place.
[Marill]: I tried going many times. But I get knocked out right away...
[Marill]: But the Water Float is very important to us.
[Marill]: I'm no match for them.
[Marill]: We didn't find it. Instead, this is what we found.
[Marill]: But many Electric-type Pok√©mon live there!
[Marill]: Yep!
[Marill]: I went to Amp Plains by myself.
[Marill]: It's too much for you. I don't want you getting into any scary scrapes.
[message_Mail]: Kunan read the message on the scrap of paper.
