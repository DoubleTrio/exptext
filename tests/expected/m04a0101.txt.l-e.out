[Loudred]: HEY, you two!
[Loudred]: We need your help with something today!
[Loudred]: Diglett, I brought them!
[Diglett]: Thank you, Loudred.
[Loudred]: You two are doing sentry duty today!
[Diglett]: Sorry. I'm usually the one to do sentry duty.
[Diglett]: But today, my dad gave me his duty of updating the boards.
[Diglett]: That's why I can't man my post.
[Diglett]: It would be great if someone could take over my sentry duty for today.
[Diglett]: And that's why you're here. Please do a good job for me. Bye!
[Loudred]: ...And that's THAT.
[Kunan](1): Huh?! I didn't follow that at all! Why are we involved?
[Kunan](2): Huh?! I didn't follow that at all! Why are we involved in this?
[Kunan](3): Huh?! I didn't follow that at all! How did we get involved in this?
[Loudred]: Shut your YAP!
[Loudred]: NO MORE BELLYACHING! GO DO YOUR DUTY!
[Kunan](1): Ugh... My head hurts...
[Kunan](2): Ow... My head is pounding...
[Kunan](3): Ow... My head hurts...
[Kunan](1): What do you expect us to do, anyway?
[Kunan](2): What are we supposed to do?
[Kunan](3): What are we expected to do, anyway?
[Loudred]: Climb down this hole and stand guard. You're on sentry duty!
[Kunan](1): Sentry duty?
[Kunan](2): Sentry duty?
[Kunan](3): Sentry duty?
[Loudred]: You heard right. Sentry duty.
[Loudred]: We can't have suspicious characters coming into the guild.
[Loudred]: So we station a sentry below the guild entrance to evaluate Pok√©mon visitors.
[Loudred]: When you first came, you had your footprint evaluated, right?
[Kunan](1): My footprint? What do you...?
[Kunan](2): My footprint? What do you...?
[Kunan](3): My footprint? What do you...?
