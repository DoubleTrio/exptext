35      [Loudred]: HEY, you two!
97      [Loudred]: We need your help with something today!
136     [Loudred]: Diglett, I brought them!
149     [Diglett]: Thank you, Loudred.
174     [Loudred]: You two are doing sentry duty today!
195     [Diglett]: Sorry. I'm usually the one to do sentry duty.
202     [Diglett]: But today, my dad gave me his duty of updating the boards.
209     [Diglett]: That's why I can't man my post.
216     [Diglett]: It would be great if someone could take over my sentry duty for today.
223     [Diglett]: And that's why you're here. Please do a good job for me. Bye!
262     [Loudred]: ...And that's THAT.
284     [Kunan](1): Huh?! I didn't follow that at all! Why are we involved?
292     [Kunan](2): Huh?! I didn't follow that at all! Why are we involved in this?
300     [Kunan](3): Huh?! I didn't follow that at all! How did we get involved in this?
347     [Loudred]: Shut your YAP!
354     [Loudred]: NO MORE BELLYACHING! GO DO YOUR DUTY!
365     [Kunan](1): Ugh... My head hurts...
373     [Kunan](2): Ow... My head is pounding...
381     [Kunan](3): Ow... My head hurts...
410     [Kunan](1): What do you expect us to do, anyway?
418     [Kunan](2): What are we supposed to do?
426     [Kunan](3): What are we expected to do, anyway?
441     [Loudred]: Climb down this hole and stand guard. You're on sentry duty!
467     [Kunan](1): Sentry duty?
475     [Kunan](2): Sentry duty?
483     [Kunan](3): Sentry duty?
500     [Loudred]: You heard right. Sentry duty.
507     [Loudred]: We can't have suspicious characters coming into the guild.
514     [Loudred]: So we station a sentry below the guild entrance to evaluate Pok√©mon visitors.
521     [Loudred]: When you first came, you had your footprint evaluated, right?
540     [Kunan](1): My footprint? What do you...?
548     [Kunan](2): My footprint? What do you...?
556     [Kunan](3): My footprint? What do you...?
