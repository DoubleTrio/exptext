[Kunan](1): Hey, Yugure.
[Kunan](2): Listen, Yugure.
[Kunan](3): Say, Yugure.
[Kunan](1): When we go to Mt. Travail, you ought to lead, Yugure.
[Kunan](2): When we go to Mt. Travail, you should be the leader, Yugure.
[Kunan](3): When we go to Mt. Travail, you should go as the leader, Yugure.
[Kunan](1): After all, that's the way we've always done it for important missions.
[Kunan](2): After all, that's the way we've always handled things on important missions.
[Kunan](3): After all, we've always gone on our important missions that way.
[Kunan](1): So I was thinking that you ought to be the leader again, Yugure... What do you say?
[Kunan](2): That's why I think you should be the leader again, Yugure... What do you say?
[Kunan](3): That's why I think you should be the leader again, Yugure... What do you say?
[case_menu]: Accept leadership
[Kunan](1): Cool! That's it, then! You're the leader, Yugure.
[Kunan](2): OK! That's settled. You're the leader, Yugure.
[Kunan](3): OK! You're the team leader, Yugure!
[Kunan](1): Let's get rolling to Mt. Travail!
[Kunan](2): Let's set out for Mt. Travail!
[Kunan](3): We should get moving to Mt. Travail!
[case_menu]: Refuse
[Kunan](1): Whoa! Hang on, we're going with me as leader?
[Kunan](2): What? Wait, so I'm going as the leader?
[Kunan](3): What? So I'm going to go as the leader?
[Kunan](1): Hmm... I don't feel confident about doing that...
[Kunan](2): Hmm... I don't have the confidence to do that...
[Kunan](3): Hmm... I don't feel confident enough to be the leader...
[Kunan](1): If we're going to Mt. Travail, you should be the leader, Yugure...
[Kunan](2): If we're going to Mt. Travail, you should be the leader, Yugure...
[Kunan](3): If we're still going to go to Mt. Travail, you should lead, Yugure...
[Kunan](1): Hey, Yugure. How about if we just go as a pair, you and I?
[Kunan](2): Listen, Yugure. What would you say if I suggested that just you and I go?
[Kunan](3): Say, Yugure. Do you think maybe we should just go as a pair, us two?
[Kunan](1): If a whole bunch of us went, it'd probably upset Drowzee beyond the point of persuasion...
[Kunan](2): If a whole group went, Drowzee would probably get upset. You can forget about persuading him then.
[Kunan](3): If a whole lot of us go, Drowzee will probably get upset with us. He would be impossible to persuade like that.
[Kunan](1): But going alone won't do it, either. One Pokémon won't be convincing enough.
[Kunan](2): But going alone won't be enough. I don't think it would be persuasive enough to get the point across.
[Kunan](3): But I think one Pokémon alone won't be persuasive enough.
[Kunan](1): So how about just we two go?
[Kunan](2): That's why I suggested the two of us go.
[Kunan](3): So what do you think? Should just the two of us go?
[case_menu]: Go as a pair
[Kunan](1): OK! Let's get going to Mt. Travail!
[Kunan](2): That's settled! Let's get going to Mt. Travail!
[Kunan](3): OK! Let's go to Mt. Travail!
[Kunan](1): Let's do our best, Yugure!
[Kunan](2): Let's do our best, Yugure!
[Kunan](3): Let's do our best, Yugure!
[case_menu]: Don't go

[Loudred]: Diglett, I brought them!
[Diglett]: Thank you, Loudred.
[Loudred]: You two are doing sentry duty today!
[Diglett]: Sorry. I'm usually the one to do sentry duty.
[Diglett]: But today, my dad gave me his duty of updating the boards.
[Diglett]: That's why I can't man my post.
[Diglett]: It would be great if someone could take over my sentry duty for today.
[Diglett]: And that's why you're here. Please do a good job for me. Bye!

[Kunan](1): Sentry duty?
[Kunan](2): Sentry duty?
[Kunan](3): Sentry duty?
[Loudred]: You heard right. Sentry duty.
[Loudred]: We can't have suspicious characters coming into the guild.
[Loudred]: So we station a sentry below the guild entrance to evaluate Pokémon visitors.
[Loudred]: When you first came, you had your footprint evaluated, right?
[Kunan](1): My footprint? What do you...?
[Kunan](2): My footprint? What do you...?
[Kunan](3): My footprint? What do you...?

[Azurill]: Kunan and Yugure! Hi there!
[Kunan](1): Huh? It's you little guys...
[Kunan](2): Oh! It's you little guys...
[Kunan](3): Hey! It's you little guys...
[Kunan](1): We heard we have visitors. Are you our visitors?
[Kunan](2): We heard we have visitors. Are you our visitors?
[Kunan](3): We heard we have visitors. Are you maybe those visitors?
[Marill]: Yep! We wanted to ask Team Spirits for help.
[Kunan](1): Help?
[Kunan](2): Help?
[Kunan](3): Help?
[Marill]: Yep!
[Azurill]: We need your help finding a Water Float.
[Kunan](1): A Water Float?
[Kunan](2): A Water Float?
[Kunan](3): A Water Float?
[Kunan](1): You've been searching for your Water Float, right?
[Kunan](2): Weren't you looking for that earlier? A Water Float?
[Kunan](3): Isn't that what you were looking for earlier? A Water Float?
[Marill]: Yep! Someone said one was lying on the beach. We went there looking for it!
[Marill]: We didn't find it. Instead, this is what we found.
[Kunan](1): This scrap of paper?
[Kunan](2): This scrap of paper?
[Kunan](3): This scrap of paper?
[Kunan](1): There's writing on it.
[Kunan](2): There's writing on it.
[Kunan](3): There's writing on it.
[message_Mail]: Kunan read the message on the scrap of paper.
[Kunan](1): Let's see. What does it say? "The Water Float from the beach..."
[Kunan](2): Let's see. What does it say? "The Water Float from the beach..."
[Kunan](3): Let's see. What does it say? "The Water Float from the beach..."
[Kunan](1): "...is now in our possession."
[Kunan](2): "...is now in our possession."
[Kunan](3): "...is now in our possession."
[Kunan](1): "Just try to take it from us! We'll wait in the deepest part of Amp Plains."
[Kunan](2): "Just try to take it from us! We'll wait in the deepest part of Amp Plains."
[Kunan](3): "Just try to take it from us! We'll wait in the deepest part of Amp Plains."

[Kunan](1): It's a ransom note! Isn't it?!
[Kunan](2): It's a ransom note! Isn't it?!
[Kunan](3): It's a ransom note! Isn't it?!
[Kunan](1): You little guys shouldn't even think about going!
[Kunan](2): You little guys! Promise me you won't go yourself.
[Kunan](3): You little guys! Please don't even think about going.
[Kunan](1): It could be a trap.
[Kunan](2): I suspect a trap.
[Kunan](3): It's probably a trap!
[Marill]: But the Water Float is very important to us.
[Marill]: We really want to get it back.
[Marill]: But I can't take Azurill to a dangerous place.
[Azurill]: I said I would go too!
[Marill]: It's too much for you. I don't want you getting into any scary scrapes.
[Marill]: I went to Amp Plains by myself.
[Marill]: But many Electric-type Pokémon live there!
[Marill]: I'm no match for them.
[Marill]: I tried going many times. But I get knocked out right away...
[Marill]: I just c-c-can't stand how weak I am...
[Kunan](1): No problem! I know what to do!
[Kunan](2): No problem! I know what to do!
[Kunan](3): No problem! I know what to do!
[Kunan](1): We'll go and get the Water Float back for you.
[Kunan](2): We'll go get the Water Float back for you.
[Kunan](3): We'll go get the Water Float back for you.
[Azurill]: Really?!
[Marill]: You will?!
[Kunan](1): Yup! So no more crying!
[Kunan](2): Yep! So no more tears!
[Kunan](3): Yep! So no more tears!
[Marill]: OK! W-we're sorry to bother you about this. Thank you!

[Kunan](2): You should see your faces! All that crying and laughing... C'mon!
[Kunan](3): You should see your faces! All that crying and laughing... C'mon!

[Kunan](2): Don't worry, though. We'll get it back for you. It's a promise!
[Kunan](3): Don't worry, though. We'll get it back for you. We promise!
[Kunan](1): Let's go, Yugure! Onward to Amp Plains!
[Kunan](2): Let's go, Yugure! We're off to Amp Plains!
[Kunan](3): Let's go, Yugure! Let's get to Amp Plains!
